Copy the first .gpx file to a safe location to get the start and end of the file when you are all done

Rename all gps trail files from "*.gpx" to "r (x).gpx" where x is the date order of the files

Change format of all gps trail files from .gpx to .txt with cmd(not powershell): ren * *.txt

Use the Notepad++ Find in Files feature to remove beginning and end of gps trail files leaving just the <trk> </trk> tags

Now you have "r (x).txt" files with just the ride gps data as <trk> </trk>

First manual part - edit Runkeeper rides Excel file and add names of trails ro Route Name column

Open the Excel file and put this in K2
=C2&" - "&D2&" miles - "&B2&" "&(TEXT(A2,"m-d-yy"))
The columns may be different, but the format should be:
Carol Place - 8.74 miles - Cycling 4-1-18

Copy the text in the K column, right click in L1, and paste them as Values in L1

Second manual part - copy all that Excel generated content in column L to each gpx files replacing
<name><![CDATA[some shit]]></name>
with
<name><![CDATA[Carol Place - 8.74 miles - Cycling 4-1-18]]></name>
Install MacroRecorder, load macro-config.mrf for quick action to paste, backspace, save, and exit as one button
From Settings, add MacroRecorder hotkey X to play macro

Open Excel to make the contents of a bash script that will append all gps trail ride file contents to merged.txt
This is already created at merge-script.sh

A			B	C							D
cat "r ( 	1	 ).txt" >> merged.txt		=A1&C1&D1
cat "r ( 	2	 ).txt" >> merged.txt		=A2&C2&D2
cat "r ( 	3	 ).txt" >> merged.txt		=A3&C3&D3
...

Copy the text in the D column, right click in E1, and paste them as Values in E1

Then copy E1 to script.sh
cat "r (1).txt" >> merged.txt
cat "r (2).txt" >> merged.txt
cat "r (3).txt" >> merged.txt
...

Copy script.sh and all "r (x).txt" files to CentOS, give script.sh permissions to execute, and run it
Can just be done locally on Windows, just find append tool

Might have to rename merged.txt^M to merged.txt

Copy merged.txt back to Windows, rename merged.txt to "2018 Merged GPX Data.gpx", zip, and upload to gpsvisualizer.com

Finish making List Excel file
