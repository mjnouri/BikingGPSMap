Copy the first .gpx file to a safe location to get the start and end of the file when you are all done

Rename all gps trail files from "*.gpx" to "r (x).gpx" where x is the date order of the files

Change format of all gps trail files from .gpx to .txt with cmd: ren * *.txt

Use the Notepad++ Find in Files feature to remove beginning and end of gps trail files leaving just the <trk> </trk> tags

Now you have "r (x).txt" files with just the ride gps data as <trk> </trk>

Open the Runkeeper rides file and put this in L2
=D2&" - "&E2&" miles - "&C2&" "&(TEXT(A2,"m-d-yy"))

Copy the text in the L column, right click in M1, and paste them as Values in M1

Now the only manual part is to copy all that Excel generated content in M1 to the gpx files replacing
<name><![CDATA[some shit]]></name>
with
<name><![CDATA[Carol Place - 8.74 miles - Cycling 4-1-18]]></name>

Open Excel to make the contents of a script that will append all gps trail ride file contents to merged.txt
A			B	C							D
cat "r( 	1	 ).txt" >> merged.txt		=A1&C1&D1
cat "r( 	2	 ).txt" >> merged.txt		=A2&C2&D2
cat "r( 	3	 ).txt" >> merged.txt		=A3&C3&D3
...

Copy the text in the D column, right click in E1, and paste them as Values in E1

Then copy E1 to script.sh
cat "r(1).txt" >> merged.txt
cat "r(2).txt" >> merged.txt
cat "r(3).txt" >> merged.txt
...

Copy script.sh and all "r (x).txt" files to CentOS, give script.sh permissions to execute, and run it

Copy all files back to Windows, rename merged.txt to "2018 Merged GPX Data.txt" and upload to gpsvisualizer.com
